<!--Scratch-->

    <button class="accordion">Scratch</button>
        <div class="panel">
             <p>My program is a puzzle game. I wrote this game in scratch using the Scratch development environment. The purpose of my game is to make the player think and use their problem-solving skills to collect keys to open doors and progress through the game. The video shows an entire playthrough of all most mechanics. It demonstrates an inventory system that keeps track of the player’s items collected. It also shows the use of a click and drag mechanic that makes two sprites interact with each other. The title and end menu both contain a mouse hover operation that changes the costume. The game also contains an input code that checks whether the user put in the right string of characters.</p>

<!--App Inventor-->

    <button class="accordion">App Inventor</button>
        <div class="panel">
              <p>I used MIT’s App Inventor to create my application. The app, “Class Time”, displays how much time before a class starts and how much time before a class ends. It also includes a feature to change the schedule from regular schedule to late start. When the application is launched, 3 buttons are presented. "Start" sends you to a screen where you can choose the period that is next and it will let you know how long until it starts, "End" send you to a screen where you can choose the period that you are in and it will tell you how long you are expected to be in that period. "Schedule" gives you a full and complete list of every schedule that is used throughout the entire school year; giving you a neat place to store that information. </p>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>The programming language that was used to develop our script was Python 2.7. The purpose of our program is to calculate the tax, tip and split functions when at a restaurant to determine a final price. The user inputs the price of the meal, then inputs the tax. Then the user inputs how many people to split the price by.This program was co-created with Connor Bartholomew.</p>

<!--Malware Presentation-->    

    <button class="accordion">Malware Presentation</button>
        <div class="panel">
          <p>The malware I chose to present is the ILOVEYOU worm. It found its way on victims computers by email. It would pretend to be some type of file that would trick the user to download it. It also faked its extension so the user would feel a false sense of security when clicking on it. Once activated, the worm changed registry settings and sent itself through your contact's linked emails to further spread. It caused damage by randomly overwriting the owner's files, ultimately causing over 15 billion dollars in damage in total. Making it one the most costly computer viruses.</p>
